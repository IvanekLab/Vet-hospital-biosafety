This is a naturalistic observation study to characterize the environment and human behavior aspects of biosafety in a large animal veterinary teaching hospital in the Northeast USA, the Cornell University Nemo Farm Animal Hospital. 
Here, we include a spreadsheet containing data collected as part of the study:
File "Hospital Observations - final for GitHub.xlsx" contains data from observations of behaviour (tabs: "Raw data 1", "Raw data 2a, "Raw data 2b" and "Raw data 3") as well as the respective calculations used to analyzed the data (tabs: "Calculation 1", "Calculation 2a" and "Calculation 3"). Tab "Table 1", shows the summary statistics from all calculations.
File "Hospital Dirtiness scoring - final for GitHub.xlsx" contains data from scoring of dirtiness (tabs: "Raw scores" and "Notations") as well as the respective summary statistics (tab: "Summary statistics").
